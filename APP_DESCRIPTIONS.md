## 🚀 What is the point?

There is a specific type of person who loves the _idea_ of **Obsidian**—local files, privacy, graph views—but hates the _reality_ of it. The reality being: spending more time managing plugins, writing frontmatter, and tweaking CSS themes than actually taking notes.

On the other hand, **Notion** is beautiful and easy, but it’s slow, online-only, and lacks the "hacker" features like code execution.

**Thoughts+** is the missing link. It is the **"Low-Maintenance Nerd App."**
It gives you the graph view, the local files, and the code execution you crave, but it wraps it in a stunning, Notion-like UI that works immediately. No plugins to install. No markdown friction. Just press a hotkey and dump your brain.

## 🎢 The Fun Run Down

You're deep in focus mode. You find a cool code snippet or have a task idea.
**The Old Way (Obsidian):** Open app -> Wait for load -> Find "Inbox" folder -> Create "Untitled Note" -> Type YAML frontmatter -> Paste content. _Momentum killed._

**The Thoughts+ Way:**
You press **`Ctrl+Shift+N`**.
A sleek overlay appears instantly over your current window.
You paste the code, type "Check this out later", or type "Meeting at 5pm" (which auto-schedules to your calendar).
You press Esc.
**Done.** You never left your context.

Later, when you actually _want_ to be nerdy, you open the main app. It looks premium (like Notion) but functions like an IDE to your brain. You open that note, add a Python block **right there**, run it to test the snippet, and see the output inline. No separate terminal. No "rendering" mode toggles. It just flows.

## ✨ Every Single Feature

Here is everything Thoughts+ can do, laid out plain and simple:

### 📝 Core Note-Taking

- **Linked Notes**: Use `@` to connect notes to each other.
- **Graph View**: Visualize your entire second brain in an interactive 2D/3D graph.
- **Nerdbooks (Code Execution)**: Embed executable **Python** and **JavaScript** cells directly in your notes. Variables even persist between cells!
- **Local Images**: Drag and drop images directly into notes.

### 📅 Smart Calendar & Tasks

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Type "Gym tomorrow at 5pm" and it happens.
- **Unified Dashboard**: See your events, tasks, and GitHub activity in one place.
- **Recurring Events**: Flexible support for daily, weekly, fortnightly, and monthly repeats.
- **Smart Series**: Group recurring events together for easy management.
- **Late Tracking**: Events aren't just "missed"; they are tracked as "Completed Late" or "Missed" for better analytics.

### ⚡ Speed & Workflow

- **Global Quick Capture (`Ctrl+Shift+N`)**: A system-wide hotkey to take notes or add tasks without opening the main app window.
- **Quick Timer (`Ctrl+Enter`)**: A floating modal to set timers using microwave-style input (type `130` for 1 minute 30 seconds).
- **Session History**: Keeps a log of your focus sessions.

### 🎨 Visual & Creative

- **Infinite Boards**: A Miro-like whiteboard experience for free.
- **Sticky Notes**: Standard stickies, Lined notes for long text, and **Calculator notes** for quick math.

## 🥊 Alternatives (And Why We're Better)

### vs. **Notion**

- **The Problem with Notion**: It's slow, online-only (mostly), and you don't really own your data.
- **Why Thoughts+ is better**: Thoughts+ is **offline-first**. It opens instantly. You can copy your folder to a USB drive and walk away. Plus, can you run Python code inside a Notion block? Didn't think so.

### vs. **Obsidian**

- **The Problem with Obsidian**: It's a "Build Your Own App" kit. To get a calendar, you need a plugin. To run code, you need a plugin. To make it look good, you need a theme. "Quick capture" is clunky. You end up being a _System Administrator_ for your notes instead of a _Note Taker_.
- **Why Thoughts+ is better**: We are **"Batteries Included."** The calendar, code execution, boards, and beautiful UI are native core features. There is no "setup tax." You don't build the system; you just use it. Plus, our **Quick Capture** (`Ctrl+Shift+N`) is native and instant—something Obsidian struggles to do well without complex setups.

### vs. **Jupyter Notebooks**

- **The Problem with Jupyter**: It's great for code, but terrible for general note-taking, task management, or carrying around in your pocket (metaphorically).
- **Why Thoughts+ is better**: Thoughts+ gives you the power of Jupyter ("Nerdbooks") wrapped in a beautiful productivity system. You can have a todo list right next to your Python script.

### vs. **TickTick / Todoist**

- **The Problem with To-Do Apps**: They are just lists. They don't handle knowledge management or deep work.
- **Why Thoughts+ is better**: We combine the "Action" (Calendar/Tasks) with the "Knowledge" (Notes/Code). Context switching kills productivity; Thoughts+ keeps it all together.

## 🏆 The Pros (Summary)

- **Zero Friction**: Global hotkeys mean you capture thoughts before you lose them.
- **True Ownership**: Local files, standard formats (Markdown/JSON).
- **Developer Friendly**: The only note app that treats code as a first-class citizen.
- **Cost**: **$0.00**. Free. Open Source. MIT License.
- **Aesthetic**: It actually looks good. Like, really good.
